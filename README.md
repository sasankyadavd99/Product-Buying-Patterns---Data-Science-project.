# Product-Buying-Patterns--Data-Science-project.

Project Description:
Straumann USA, LLC, a global leader in esthetic dentistry based in Andover, MA, is dedicated to transforming lives by enhancing oral health, boosting self-confidence, and restoring self-esteem. This project aimed to identify customer buying patterns and create predictive models to forecast what products customers are likely to buy and which additional products they might be interested in bundling. The objective was to build confidence in the metrics of frequently bought products and predict what other products a customer might buy or be influenced to buy alongside their current bundle.

Project Details:

Goals:

Identify customer buying patterns.
Create predictive models for product purchases.
Enable cross-selling and up-selling opportunities.
Enhance marketing campaign targeting.
Tools and Libraries Used:

Python: Core programming language for data analysis and model development.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
scikit-learn: Machine learning model building and evaluation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
SQL: Database querying.
BigQuery: Large-scale data analysis.
Databricks: Collaborative data engineering and data science.
AWS: Cloud computing and storage.
Streamlit: Interactive web applications for data exploration and visualization.
Methodologies:

Data Collection: Aggregated sales data and customer information from various sources.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns and insights using statistical methods and visualization.
Feature Engineering: Created new features to improve model performance.
Model Development: Used machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict customer buying patterns.
Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Implemented models in a scalable environment and integrated with existing systems.
Feedback Loop: Designed the model to retrain itself based on new data and campaign results.
Deliverables:
The project aimed to provide the marketing team with actionable insights to select target customers and design focused campaigns. This would enable Straumann Group to cross-sell and up-sell products effectively based on customer needs. Post-marketing campaign, the data model is capable of retraining itself based on feedback, ensuring continuous improvement and accuracy.

Impact:
This project holds significant potential for enabling Straumann Group to optimize their marketing strategies, ultimately leading to enhanced revenue and improved customer retention. By leveraging advanced data science methodologies, the predictive models we developed can help identify and target specific customer segments, allowing the marketing team to design and execute more effective, focused campaigns. This could result in more precise cross-selling and up-selling opportunities, ensuring that customers receive the products that best meet their needs.

The adaptive nature of the model ensures it will continue to evolve and improve over time. By retraining itself based on new data and feedback from marketing campaigns, the model can maintain its accuracy and relevance, adapting to changing customer behaviors and preferences. This continuous learning capability is crucial for sustaining growth and keeping customers engaged with Straumann Group's products.

Moreover, this project exemplifies how advanced data science and machine learning can drive business success. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, we are not only improving operational efficiency but also enhancing the overall customer experience. This initiative underscores the importance of leveraging technology to stay competitive in the market and deliver value to both the business and its customers.

I am proud to support Straumann Group's mission of transforming lives through esthetic dentistry by providing innovative solutions and actionable insights. This project showcases our commitment to using cutting-edge technology to make a meaningful impact on both the business and its customers. ðŸŒŸ
